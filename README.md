# Parser

# You can run the program by typing in command line:

java -jar C:\Users\Jose\Documents\prep\parser\out\artifacts\parser_jar\parser.jar sortBy filepath

# where sortBy can be:
first : to sort by first name

last : to sort by last name

date : to sort by date

# filepath is the path of the textfile with the records.

# An example of something that works on my computer:

java -jar C:\Users\Jose\Documents\prep\parser\out\artifacts\parser_jar\parser.jar last C:\\Users\\Jose\\Documents\\prep\\parser\\src\\inputfile1.txt

I included inputfile1.txt and inputfile2.txt which I used to test format 1 and format 2 
you can find it in the src folder

For source inputfile1.txt the records are exactly 80 characters long and the program won't work for anything less or greater than as per the instructions

Output is outputed at a default location in the project folder where you clone thing repo. i.e. /.../project/output.tx
